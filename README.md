# weather.py

[OpenNMS](http://opennms.org) is the worldâ€™s first enterprise grade network management application platform developed under the open source model. This python script will display weather data on the OpenNMS dashboard.

This is the second version of this script. The first version utilized the weather underground API which, unfortunately, is no longer free. https://apicommunity.wunderground.com/weatherapi/topics/end-of-service-for-the-weather-underground-api. It has been re-written to use the weather.gov API. Currently api.weather.gov does not require an API key.

Weather.gov only updates their observation data once an hour. I still recommend running this script every ten minutes so you pull the latest alert data for your zone and radar data. Radar support has been added and the map can be turned on/off. This script has been tested with Python 2.7.5 and Python 3.7.1

## Install
1. Edit `weather.py` add your weather station id (https://forecast.weather.gov/stations.php)
2. Edit `weather.py` add your weather zone id (https://www.weather.gov/pimar/PubZone)
3. Edit `weather.py` add your radar station id
4. Copy `weather.py` to `/opt/opennms/bin`
5. Create a cronjob that will run the `weather.py` script `*/10 * * * * /bin/python /opt/opennms/bin/weather.py > /dev/null 2>&1`
6. Edit `/opt/opennms/jetty-webapps/opennms/index.jsp` and add the below block of code to the appropriate column.
```
<!-- weather box -->
<jsp:include page="/includes/weather.jsp" flush="false" />
```
To add the weather panel to the top of the right column the code would look like
```
<!-- Right Column -->
        <div class="col-md-3" id="index-contentright">
                <!-- weather box -->
                <jsp:include page="/includes/weather.jsp" flush="false" />
```

## Issues
This script has been tested against the latest versions of OpenNMS Horizon and Meridian. After each OpenNMS upgrade you will need to add the code block back to `index.jsp`
